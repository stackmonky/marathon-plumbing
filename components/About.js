                I have loved organizing since the age of 12. Keeping my room tidy, rearranging furniture and cleaning out my family pantry for fun. My love of being neat and tidy led me to jobs in retail where I would organize the stock room and help fold the clothes on the sales floor. Later, I found that inventory was a great outlet to perfect my need to categorize and group while enforcing systems and standards.

                After marriage, kids and divorce I dove into the world of Heath Coaching. With a love of helping people reach their health goals and discover healthy routines that work for their lives I felt like a component was missing. One day, everything fell into place and the missing piece was home organizing. When we have systems that work and a flow in our homes that isn&apos;t interrupted by extra stuff and a place for everything, our homes can feel much calmer and more peaceful.
